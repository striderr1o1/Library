# JS Library Project
This is a Library that I have created using javascript. I have used JS concepts such as constructors, objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, etc. 

## Features:
1) simple UI
2) add books with title, author, page count and read-status.
3) delete books

## Problems Faced
I made the script.js twice. The reason was, the first time, things didnt go well. I had not mapped how to implement the problem the right way, and that caused problems/mistakes. So, i made another one, but this time, after mapping the problem. I got it right this time.

### Note:
UI isnt very impressive, because UI is not the concern here, rather its the javascript logic.
